With eyes like once heated milk
With the film of skin
In the simplicity of your need
You live all over me

You climb me like a tower
It's something like certainty
For you

Tables turning out in the cold
I'm left out in the cold
With eyes like once-heated milk
With the skin of film

(Chorus)

Admire you like a tower
It's something like your simplicity
Admire you like a tower
It's something like that
