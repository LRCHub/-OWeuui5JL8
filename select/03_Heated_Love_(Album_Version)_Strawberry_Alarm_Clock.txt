Heated love and summer sky
Can give us a vibrant high
When our hearts are warm and tight
We'll cling together, never die

Lazy days with things to do
Giving me time to watch over you
With dark-light hair and eyes of blue
That's my crystalline view of you

Our love so intense with the friction of living
Knowing the spark of our life's togetherness
For if we should ever get cold and alone
Each would be as an iceberg, glowing in the wilderness

Heated love and summer sky
Can give us a vibrant high
When our hearts are warm and tight
Cling together, never die
